# Team Grenade Damage

This is a CS:GO plugin to block all damage from teammates except grenades, grenade hits (all), and molotov/incendiary.

This is necessary because the CVAR that controls the damage from molotov/incendiary damage is the same CVAR that controls knife damage and I don't want knife damage to be activated as well.
